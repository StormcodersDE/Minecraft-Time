			New

			Conduits

			 * Added Refined Storage conduits. Mimic the functionality of refined storage cables.
			 * Re-added ME Conduits. Dense (32 channel) and normal (8 channel).
			 * Re-added OC Conduits.
			Redstone Filters

			 * Added Redstone Filters. These are used to modify the input or output signals of a redstone conduit.
			 * Basic Logic Filters (Output) - AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR.
			 * NOT Filter (Output) - Redstone signal of strength 15 if there is no input, otherwise signal strength of 0.
			 * Toggle Filter (Output) - Toggled between on and off each time it receives a signal.
			 * Counting Filter (Output) - Requires a signal to be inputted a number of times before it will output a signal.
			 * Inventory Sensor Filter (Input) - Inputs the connected block's comparator output (if it has one).
			 * Timer Filter (Input) - Inputs a signal of strength 15 each pulse.
			Additions

			 * New purple power bar texture. The Wired Charger, Power Buffers, Energy Gauges and Capacitor Banks have been updated to match.
			 * New Dimensional Transceiver model. Much more blocky, and ender-y.
			 * New textures for all conduits.
			 * Added Thaumcraft integration. This includes aspects, infusion stabilising endermen heads and darksteel upgrades.

			 * Added a gui to the XP Vacuum to allow range configuration.

	Thermal Dynamics (went from ThermalDynamics-1.12.2-2.4.1.10-universal.jar to ThermalDynamics-1.12.2-2.5.1.13-universal.jar):
		ThermalDynamics-1.12.2-2.5.1.13-universal.jar:

			[https://github.com/CoFH/Version/blob/master/thermaldynamics_changelog.txt](https://github.com/CoFH/Version/blob/master/thermaldynamics_changelog.txt)

	Thermal Expansion (went from ThermalExpansion-1.12.2-5.4.2.27-universal.jar to ThermalExpansion-1.12.2-5.5.0.29-universal.jar):
		5.5.0:
			GENERAL:
				-We've updated our privacy policy.*

				-Lots of new config options. These in particular are notable:
					The number of Augment Slots for Dynamos and Machines can be set for each level.

					There is a config option to disable upgrade functionality. This only applies to in-world
					upgrades.

					The Fisher and Tapper can be configured to *require* bait or fertilizer to produce stuff.

				-Lots of Plugin updates.
				-JSON-Based Content Addition System.
					This can be considered partially complete - not all Machines are supported, and not all
					recipe styles are supported either. Some hardcoding is required due to the strange way that
					Minecraft deals with certain items. Lookin' at you, Potions.

					There will be more on this later and the website will be updated with the default content
					files and examples. But basically, you can add/overwrite a lot of default recipes and fuels
					in the mod, and set the "Oredict" defaults for many outputs. Removal is currently not
					supported.

					So, if you don't agree with some particular value in TE, you might be able to change it now!

			ADDED:
				-New Augment:
					-Agitating Manifold (Compression Dynamo): greatly improves power output	and efficiency when
						using Refined Biofuel - "Grassoline".
				-New Device:
					Vacuumulator. It sucks up items in an area and has configurable filtering.

				-Biofuel processing line. You'll need a Sawmill.
				-GUI Tooltips for Dynamo Fuels; values are specific to *that* Dynamo, including augs/coolant.
				-Reservoirs now render the fluid contained within.

			CHANGED:
				-Coolants and Fuels have been rebalanced a bit. This includes a substantial "nerf" to Tree Oil.
				-Item Allocator now has configurable filtering to determine what it will accept/transfer. :)
				-Some processing recipes have been adjusted.

			FIXED:
				-Dye removal recipes have been fixed for the Reservoir.

			*We don't have a privacy policy. This is a joke. There is no telemetry  or data mining/scraping in
				any CoFH mod.

	Thermal Foundation (went from ThermalFoundation-1.12.2-2.4.1.15-universal.jar to ThermalFoundation-1.12.2-2.5.0.19-universal.jar):
		2.5.0:
			GENERAL:
				-Minor update, but pulls in breaking changes from CoFHCore. So it's a major update. ;)

			ADDED:
				-Biomass, Bioblend, and associated fluids. (Biocrude, Seed Oil, Grassoline)
				-Horse armors in various metals.
				-Pyrotheum-based crafting table recipes for Hardened Glass.

				-CTM support for Hardened Glass.
				-Wrench support for Buildcraft and EnderIO.

			CHANGED:
				-Default worldgen files have been altered to use properties instead of metadata.
				-Holding a Redprint or Signalum Security Lock in your offhand will automatically attempt to use
					it when placing a block supporting those features.

			FIXED:
				-Various recipes now use sticks and not strings. Woops.
