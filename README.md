# Minecraft-Time

Minecraft Time is a Modpack created by DebitorLP.

Generally speaking, Minecraft Time is a highly tech-based modpack. Hundreds of modifications are only waiting to be explored by players. Discover the possibilities of popular mods, from Extreme Reactors to Draconic Evolution. Soon, you'll find out that the sky is, in fact, not the limit when you build your own rockets with Advanced Rocketry and explore outer space! However, this pack does not only include extensive mainstream mods, but also smaller ones such as Sync, for cloning players, or Matter Overdrive, which lets you shed your human shell and become a droid. Not your cup of tea? Then maybe you're in the mood for your own storyline! With Custom NPCs you can create your own fractions with your very own quests.

This pack is based on the highly successful (German) Minecraft project After Humans, which was only available for version 1.7.10. It was set in a post-apocalyptic world with humanity trying to recover from a global catastrophe. The updated Minecraft Time offers you full 1.12 performance combined with an outstanding collection of mods.
